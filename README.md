The main code is in the E--_compiler folder.

First compile the assembler program:

make

then:

cd E--_compiler
make


Right now the compile process is done. The file test1 is the most important case to test our program. You can run:

sh test.sh

to test the compiler by following the prompt. The test input event is generated by the python srcipt named input_gen.py under the main direction.
